All about me, for those interested.

◊h2{Work}

I am a software engineer experienced in program design for application software and test development. I am currently at
Mujin, in Tokyo, where we try to make robotic systems smart.

◊h2{Fun}

I fill my time with a few different pursuits including disc golf, origami, travel, skiing, photography, vidya,
calligraphy, and of course keeping my programming in shape.
